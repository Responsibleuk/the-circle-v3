            <p>We are constantly looking for inspiration. For facts and statements that inspire us, surprise us and motivate us. Here is a collection of facts we have compiled so far:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>It takes more energy to make 1 kg of paper than it takes to make 1 kg of steel</li>
        <li>It takes almost 500,000 litres of water to extract just 1 kg of gold</li>
        <li>1 kwh of electricity from a UK plug socket takes almost 3 kwh of energy to produce</li>
        <li>Switching from the font ‘Arial’ to ‘Century Gothic’ saves 30% ink on printing</li>
        <li>More energy is wasted in the UK’s electricity generation system than is consumed to heat all of the UK’s homes</li>
        <li>There is up to 30 times more gold in a tonne of old mobile phones than in a tonne of gold ore</li>
        <li>Around 16,000 litres of water is consumed to make just 1 kg of beef</li>
        <li>Recycling a single 330 ml aluminium drink can saves enough energy to power a TV for over 3 hours</li>
        <li>Recycling a single 500 ml aluminium beer can saves enough energy to power a TV for over 4 hours</li>

        <li>Transporting goods by a rigid road truck is over 70 times more carbon intensive than bulk shipping</li>
