          <h3>Facts</h3>
          <p>"The impacts of future changes in climate extremes are expected to fall disproportionately on the poor." -- Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
          </p>
          <ol>
<li>The Rural Poor and Indigenous Peoples: "Climate change would probably exacerbate hunger and poverty around the world... People who are highly dependent on farming, fishing or forestry will well see their livelihoods destroyed." -The United Nations Environment Programme
</li>
<li>The Urban Poor: "Climate change will be accompanied by an increase in heat waves, often exacerbated by increased humidity and urban air pollution, which would cause an increase in heat-related deaths...The impact would be greatest in urban populations, affecting particularly the elderly, sick and those without access to air-conditioning." -- Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
</li>
  <li>The Coastal Dwelling Poor: IPCC predicts "a widespread increase in the risk of flooding for many human settlements... from both increased heavy precipitation and sea-level rise." Particularly hard hit will be low-lying countries like Bangladesh and small island states whose very existence is threatened.
  </li>
    <li>Communities Already Affected by the Oil Industry: Communities that already bear the brunt of oil company activities-such as the Ogoni in the Niger Delta, the Gwich'in in the Arctic Refuge, or African Americans in Norco, Louisiana-face a "double whammy." First they are hit by the local environmental and human rights problems associated by the oil industry. And then they face the prospect of their communities being flooded or destroyed by climate change.

          <h3>What</h3>
          <p>Climate change, an inherently social issue, can upset anyone’s daily life in countless ways. But not all climate impacts are created equal, or distributed equally. From extreme weather to rising sea levels, the effects of climate change often have disproportionate effects on historically marginalized or underserved communities. “Climate justice” is a term, and more than that a movement, that acknowledges climate change can have differing social, economic, public health, and other adverse impacts on underprivileged populations. Advocates for climate justice are striving to have these inequities addressed head-on through long-term mitigation and adaptation strategies.</p>
