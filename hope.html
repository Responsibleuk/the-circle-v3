        <h2>Lifestyle</h2>
        <p>
          Carbon neutrality means balancing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by ‘offsetting’ – or removing
          from the atmosphere – an equivalent amount of carbon for the amount produced.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can be achieved by buying ‘carbon credits’ – in essence, permission to emit carbon dioxide
          or other GHG in exchange for offsetting the effects of those emissions – and/or by supporting
          GHG-reduction initiatives such as renewable-energy projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, a commitment to carbon neutrality does not require (or even necessarily imply) a
          commitment to reduce overall GHG emissions. A carbon-neutral business needs only to offset the
          GHG emissions it produces – even if those emissions are increasing.
        </p>

      <p>
        In contrast, a commitment to net-zero carbon means reducing greenhouse gas emissions with the goal
        of balancing the emissions produced and emissions removed from the earth’s atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take, as a simplified example, the case of air travel: if, in total, people within a given business
        take 10 flights per year, the organisation could achieve carbon neutrality for those 10 flights
        simply by buying enough carbon credits or by supporting renewable-energy projects to offset the
        emissions (or a combination of the two).
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve net-zero carbon, the company would need to reduce the number of flights per year as much
        as possible (to five, for instance) and also invest in projects that remove from the atmosphere the
        carbon dioxide produced by emissions from the other five flights.
