        <h2>Global Solutions</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          A third of the food raised or prepared does not make it from farm or factory to fork. Producing uneaten food
          squanders a whole host of resources—seeds, water, energy, land, fertilizer, hours of labor, financial
          capital—and generates greenhouse gases at every stage—including methane when organic matter lands in the
          global rubbish bin. The food we waste is responsible for roughly 8 percent of global emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Losing food to one waste heap or another is an issue in both high- and low-income countries. In places where
          income is low, wastage is generally unintentional and occurs earlier in the supply chain—food rots on farms or
          spoils during storage or distribution. In regions of higher income, willful food waste dominates farther along
          the supply chain. Retailers and consumers reject food based on bumps, bruises, and coloring, or simply order,
          buy, and serve too much.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are numerous and varied ways to address key waste points. In lower-income countries, improving
          infrastructure for storage, processing, and transportation is essential. In higher-income regions, major
          interventions are needed at the retail and consumer levels. National food-waste targets and policies can
          encourage widespread change. Beyond addressing emissions, these efforts can also help to meet future food
          demand.
