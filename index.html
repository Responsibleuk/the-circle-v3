          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <h4>
            Roughly a third of the world’s food is never eaten, which means land and resources used and greenhouse gases
            emitted in producing it were unnecessary. Interventions can reduce loss and waste, as food moves from farm to
            fork, thereby reducing overall demand.

          <h2>What We Do</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            A third of the food raised or prepared does not make it from farm or factory to fork. Producing uneaten food
            squanders a whole host of resources—seeds, water, energy, land, fertilizer, hours of labor, financial
            capital—and generates greenhouse gases at every stage—including methane when organic matter lands in the
            global rubbish bin. The food we waste is responsible for roughly 8 percent of global emissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Losing food to one waste heap or another is an issue in both high- and low-income countries. In places where
            income is low, wastage is generally unintentional and occurs earlier in the supply chain—food rots on farms or
            spoils during storage or distribution. In regions of higher income, willful food waste dominates farther along
            the supply chain. Retailers and consumers reject food based on bumps, bruises, and coloring, or simply order,
            buy, and serve too much.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are numerous and varied ways to address key waste points. In lower-income countries, improving
            infrastructure for storage, processing, and transportation is essential. In higher-income regions, major
            interventions are needed at the retail and consumer levels. National food-waste targets and policies can
            encourage widespread change. Beyond addressing emissions, these efforts can also help to meet future food
            demand.

        <h2>The Facts</h2>
        <h4>We are constantly looking for inspiration. For facts and statements that inspire us, surprise us and motivate
          us. Here is a collection of facts we have compiled so far:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>It takes more energy to make 1 kg of paper than it takes to make 1 kg of steel</li>
          <li>It takes almost 500,000 litres of water to extract just 1 kg of gold</li>
          <li>1 kwh of electricity from a UK plug socket takes almost 3 kwh of energy to produce</li>
          <li>Switching from the font ‘Arial’ to ‘Century Gothic’ saves 30% ink on printing</li>
          <li>More energy is wasted in the UK’s electricity generation system than is consumed to heat all of the UK’s
            homes</li>
          <li>There is up to 30 times more gold in a tonne of old mobile phones than in a tonne of gold ore</li>
          <li>Around 16,000 litres of water is consumed to make just 1 kg of beef</li>
          <li>Recycling a single 330 ml aluminium drink can saves enough energy to power a TV for over 3 hours</li>
          <li>It takes around 2,700 litres of water to make a single cotton t-shirt</li>
          <li>The embodied carbon of constructing an average UK house is equivalent to driving around the earth over 10
            times</li>
          <li>23 new steps have been added to Mexico City’s Angel of Independence. Over-abstraction of ground water has
            caused the city to sink 9 m in the last 100 years</li>
          <li>1 tonne of CO2e is enough to power a UK light bulb for 10 years. In France it’s enough for over 50 years
          </li>
          <li>Our name The Circle is influenced by the circular economy and the shape of our planet which we are trying to
            save</li>
          <li>Transporting goods by a rigid road truck is over 70 times more carbon intensive than bulk shipping</li>
          <li>Disposable batteries produce 50 times less energy than the embodied energy of production</li>
