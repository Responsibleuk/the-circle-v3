          <h4>
            Not all climate impacts are created equal, or distributed equally. From extreme weather to rising sea
            levels, the effects of climate change often have disproportionate effects on historically marginalized or
            underserved
            communities. “Climate justice” is a term, and more than that a movement, that acknowledges climate change
            can have differing social, economic, public health, and other adverse impacts on underprivileged
            populations.

        <h2>Global Solutions</h2>
        <p>The Rural Poor and Indigenous Peoples: "Climate change would probably exacerbate hunger and poverty
          around the world... People who are highly dependent on farming, fishing or forestry will well see their
          livelihoods destroyed." -The United Nations Environment Programme
        </p>
        <p>The Urban Poor: "Climate change will be accompanied by an increase in heat waves, often exacerbated by
          increased humidity and urban air pollution, which would cause an increase in heat-related deaths...The
          impact would be greatest in urban populations, affecting particularly the elderly, sick and those without
          access to air-conditioning." -- Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
        </p>
        <p>The Coastal Dwelling Poor: IPCC predicts "a widespread increase in the risk of flooding for many human
          settlements... from both increased heavy precipitation and sea-level rise." Particularly hard hit will be
          low-lying countries like Bangladesh and small island states whose very existence is threatened.
        </p>
        <p>Communities Already Affected by the Oil Industry: Communities that already bear the brunt of oil company
          activities-such as the Ogoni in the Niger Delta, the Gwich'in in the Arctic Refuge, or African Americans
          in Norco, Louisiana-face a "double whammy." First they are hit by the local environmental and human rights
          problems associated by the oil industry. And then they face the prospect of their communities being
          flooded or destroyed by climate change.
